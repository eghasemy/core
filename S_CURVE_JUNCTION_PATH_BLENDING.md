# S-Curve Junction Velocity Optimization and Path Blending

This document describes the advanced junction velocity optimization and path blending features integrated with the 7-phase S-curve acceleration system in grblHAL.

## Overview

The Junction Velocity Optimization and Path Blending system provides professional-grade motion control by:

1. **Junction Velocity Optimization**: Intelligently calculates optimal velocities at path junctions while respecting S-curve jerk limits
2. **Path Blending**: Smoothly blends multiple path segments for continuous motion through complex geometry
3. **Multi-Block Lookahead**: Analyzes sequences of moves to optimize overall motion quality
4. **Adaptive Jerk Control**: Dynamically adjusts jerk limits based on path characteristics

## Algorithm Details

### Junction Velocity Calculation

The junction velocity optimization uses the following algorithm:

1. **Geometric Analysis**: Calculate junction angle and path characteristics
2. **Jerk Constraint**: Apply S-curve jerk limits to determine maximum safe velocity
3. **Adaptive Adjustment**: Modify limits based on move length and complexity
4. **Blend Consideration**: Factor in path blending requirements

```c
// Simplified algorithm
float optimized_velocity = min_velocity * junction_velocity_factor;
float jerk_limit = base_jerk * junction_jerk_multiplier;

if (junction_angle < smooth_junction_angle) {
    float angle_factor = junction_angle / smooth_junction_angle;
    optimized_velocity *= (0.5f + 0.5f * angle_factor);
}

float jerk_velocity_limit = sqrt(jerk_limit * blend_tolerance);
optimized_velocity = min(optimized_velocity, jerk_velocity_limit);
```

### Path Blending Algorithm

Path blending uses geometric constraints and jerk limits:

1. **Blend Radius Calculation**: Determine maximum safe blend radius
2. **Jerk Constraint**: Ensure blending respects S-curve jerk limits
3. **Geometric Constraint**: Limit blending to path tolerance
4. **Velocity Optimization**: Optimize velocities through blended sections

```c
// Blend radius constraints
float max_radius_geometric = min_segment_length * 0.25f;
float max_radius_jerk = velocity² / jerk_limit;
float max_radius_angle = blend_tolerance / sin(junction_angle / 2);

float blend_radius = min(max_radius_geometric, 
                        min(max_radius_jerk, max_radius_angle));
```
